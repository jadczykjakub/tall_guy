## Discriminated Unions

powerful feature in TypeScript that allow you to model a variable that can be one of several different types


<Question text="What are union types " />


A union type is a type that could be one of s
everal types. For example, string | number


<Question text="what is Discriminant Property" />
 
A discriminant property is a common property that exists in all types within the union, but with different literal values


```ts
interface Circle {
  kind: 'circle';
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  sideLength: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
  kind: 'rectangle';
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square | Rectangle;
```


Usually we can use it with **switch** and make sure all possible cases are handled, ensuring that every type in the discriminated union is accounted for

```ts
function area(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    case 'rectangle':
      return shape.width * shape.height;
      ...
  }
}
```

## Const Assertion

In TypeScript, a _const assertion_ is a technique to define a value as a literal that should not change. This is done using the **as const** keyword. When a value is asserted as **const**, TypeScript treats it as read-only and narrows its type to the most specific type possible. Here's an example:

```ts
const Color = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;

type TColor = (typeof Color)[number];

const blue: TColor = "blue"
```

In the above example, **Color** is defined as a constant array of literal string values **"red"**, **"green"**, and **"blue"**. By using **as const**, we tell TypeScript to infer the most specific types for the array elements, effectively creating a read-only tuple. The **TColor** type then extracts the literal types from this tuple, making *"red" | "green" | "blue"** the only possible values for **blue**.


You might wonder, how does this differ from using a union type??

```ts
type Rgb = "red" | "green" | "blue";

const red: Rgb = "red";
```

While both approaches define a limited set of values, **const** assertions offer additional advantages. The main reason to use **const** assertions is that they allow for more dynamic and iterable operations.

```ts
for (const item of Color) {
    console.log(item)
}
```

Const assertions can also be applied to objects,

```ts
const Product = {
    title: "t-shirt",
    price: "20$",
    color: "red"
} as const;


let k: keyof typeof Product;

for (k in Product){
    console.log(`key = ${k}, value = ${Product[k]} `)
```

Using **keyof typeof Product**, we can dynamically iterate over the object's keys.


or we can use it like that 

```ts
type TProduct = (typeof Product)[keyof typeof Product];

const priceProduct: TProduct = Product.price;
```

## Generics

Generics are a way to create components that work with multiple types instead of just a single one.

For example, you have a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a number:

```ts
function ourFunction(param: number): number {
  return param;
}
```

After some time, you need to extend this function to take a string as well. Now, you have to rewrite the code to accommodate this change.

<Question text="Why should we use any type" />

We try to avoid using **any** because it results in losing type safety, which goes against the entire purpose of using types in TypeScript. Using **any** can lead to unexpected behavior and errors that are hard to track down.

We dont do it!
```ts
function ourFunction(param: any): any {
  return param;
}
```

Thanks to **Generics**, we can achieve the desired flexibility while maintaining type safety.

Imagine a scenario where you want a function to return whatever type of data you pass to it, without explicitly defining the return type. Here's how you can use generics to do this:

```ts
function ourFunction<T>(param: T): T {
  return param;
};

```

Now, we can pass different types as arguments, and the function will return exactly the type we intended to use:

```ts
ourFunction(12);

ourFunction("hello world")
```


We can use generics also with 

**Arrays**

```ts
function getFirstElement<T>(elements: T[]): T {
    return elements[0];
}

```

**Interfaces**

```ts
interface Pair<T, U> {
    first: T;
    second: U;
}

let stringNumberPair: Pair<string, number> = {
    first: "hello",
    second: 42,
};

let booleanArrayPair: Pair<boolean, boolean[]> = {
    first: true,
    second: [true, false, true],
};
```

**Clasess**

```ts
class GenericBox<T> {
    contents: T;

    constructor(value: T) {
        this.contents = value;
    }

    getContents(): T {
        return this.contents;
    }
}

let numberBox = new GenericBox<number>(123);
console.log(numberBox.getContents()); // 123

let stringBox = new GenericBox<string>("TypeScript");
console.log(stringBox.getContents()); // TypeScript
```


**Keyof Constraint**

```ts
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) {
    return obj[key];
}

let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
let name = getProperty(person, "name"); // Valid
```

## Conclusion

Together, these features empower developers to write cleaner, more efficient, and scalable code, leveraging the full potential of TypeScript's type system.
