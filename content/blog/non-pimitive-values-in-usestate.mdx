shortDescription: 'Comparing Non-Primitive Values and Their Implications for useState in React'
---

Let's start by understanding what happens when we compare primitive and non-primitive values in JavaScript.


### Comparing Primitive Values

```js
const a = "test"; const b = "test"; 
console.log(a === b); // Output: true
```

In this example, since both **a** and **b** hold the same string value, the comparison returns **true**.

### Comparing Non-Primitive Values (Objects)

```js
const a =  {
	title: "test"
};

const b = {
	title: "test"
}

console.log(a === b);
// output: false
```

The result is **false** because, in JavaScript, objects (which are non-primitive values) are compared by reference, not by value. This means that even though **a** and **b** contain identical properties and values, they are stored in different locations in memory. Since they reference different objects, the comparison returns **false**, which is expected behavior.

### Implications for useState

### Overwriting Primitive Values

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState('test');

const handleButton = () => setValue('test');
```

When you click **handleButton**, React checks whether the **value** state has changed. Since you're setting the state to the same primitive value ('test'), React recognizes that the value hasn't changed, so it doesn't trigger a re-render.
### Overwriting Non-Primitive Values

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState({ title: "test" });

const handleButton = () => setValue({title: "test"});
```

In this case, every time you click **handleButton**, React will trigger a re-render. Even though the new object has the same content as the previous one, React compares objects by reference, not by value. Since each **setValue** call creates a new object in memory, React interprets it as a different value and re-renders the component.

It's important to be aware of this behavior, as unnecessary re-renders can negatively impact performance.
