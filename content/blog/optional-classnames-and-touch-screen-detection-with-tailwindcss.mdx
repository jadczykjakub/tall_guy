In this article, I’ll show you a clear method for applying conditional classes in TailwindCSS using the following libraries:

- classnames
- tailwind-merge

### A Less Readable Example

Let's start with a less readable example of conditional class handling in Tailwind:

```jsx
className={`${isScrolled ? "h-20" : "h-24"}`}
```

This approach can quickly become difficult to manage, especially as the number of classes and conditions increases.

### Creating a Helper Function
To improve readability and maintainability, we can create a helper function:

```jsx
import classnames from 'classnames'
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

export function cn(...args: classnames.ArgumentArray) {
  return twMerge(classnames(...args))
}
```

### A More Readable Example

Now, using our helper function, we can rewrite the previous example in a much more readable way:

```js
className={cn('h-24', {
	'h-20': isScrolled,
})}
```

This approach enforces a standard writing style across your application, which is especially helpful when dealing with many classes and conditional logic.

### Detecting Touch Screens with TailwindCSS 

With CSS, we can detect whether a user’s device has a touch screen or a mouse pointer. We can use this information to create custom styles for both mobile and desktop environments.

This is particularly useful when dealing with hover states. On mobile devices, where hover interactions don’t exist, relying on hover states can cause issues.

### Extending TailwindCSS Configuration

In your **tailwind.config.ts**, you can add custom screen definitions to handle touch and hover-specific styles:

```css
theme: {
  extend: {
    screens: {
      'touchScr': { 'raw': '(hover: none)' },
      'hoverScr': { 'raw': '(hover: hover)' },
    },

  },
},
```

### Applying Custom Styles

Now, you can use these custom screens as classes in your components:

```jsx
<div className="touchScr:bg-black hoverScr:bg-red"">
```

This method allows you to detect mobile devices and create custom styles tailored to both touch and non-touch environments.
